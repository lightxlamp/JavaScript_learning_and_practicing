Wasted some time generating icons and playing with them. - No success in installing app
Then noticed this guy changes "start_url" config. Done the same and worked for me. Was able to download my app

- 3. OneSignal. Erick in 2019 was uisng it in "Highlanders" app.
     but #1 according to this article is "PushEngage". Let's try it then.
     Signed up. Filled Card data :) Received code to paste. Decided to hide some data in .env file. Need to refresh knowledge
     and check one more lesson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txGL-Ld9zD8&ab_channel=dcode (How to .env)
     https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-environment-variables-in-vanillajs/
     Read. But will skip for now :) To focus on main topic

Well done! I've just pasted script. And completed guide on "PushEngage". Refreshed PWA on my phone.
And now I have shiny "PushNotification" request popup at the bottom of this app

Update. No need to hide this part:

```
<script src="https://clientcdn.pushengage.com/core/aeaf5e60-7581-42e1-9225-89285ebde164.js" async=""></script>
```

Because user sees it in a browser anyway

> > > offer will be applied automatically - freaking "PushEngage" XD ... Wants to still my money. I'have not sent anything yet

Tested 4 times. I was able to receive push apps on mac / Samsung S9 (even using) a nice kitty images. Now it's time to remove account

A lot of efforts and account finally removed. I hope they will not charge me after 45 hours :)

Will attach some screens here later. Have a nice day / night :)
