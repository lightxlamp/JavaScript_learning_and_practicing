Spent a lot of time trying to install Tailwind, following both the lesson and the official docs:
https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vue-3-vite.
Tried different Node versions 
Seems like this is the correct article:
https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#vue
npx tailwindcss init -p â€” worked now.

vue-jobs-new - is a final project 
To launch, please run: 
1) npm run dev 
2) npm run json-server (in the second tab)
